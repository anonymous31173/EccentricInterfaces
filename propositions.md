###Brief
Working in pairs, use analogue methods, observe, measure, collect or record an element of the environment. Come to class ready to present the results and documentation of your process. You should note, where did you go, why you selected this place or thing, what was your method and why you chose this method.  

###Inspiration:
Check out the resources page of the repository under environmental observation.  
Consider the following prompts: 
* How would you use an ephemeral substance like chalk to mark something in the environment over time?
* How can you use your body to measure an environment or dynamic process within it?
* Is your observation to be a momentary recording, a trace left over time, or a comparative observation.
