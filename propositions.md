##Proposition 0: Indexical drawing

###Brief
Working in pairs, use analogue methods to create or record an index of some element of the environment. Come to class ready to present the results and documentation of your process. You should note, where did you go, why you selected this place or thing, what was your method and why you chose this method.  

###Inspiration:
Check out the resources page of the repository under environmental observation.  
Consider the following prompts: 
* How would you use an ephemeral substance like chalk to mark something in the environment over time?
* How can you use your body to measure an environment or dynamic process within it?
* Is your observation to be a momentary recording, a trace left over time, or a comparative observation.

##Proposition 1: Antropomorphising a datastream

##Project Brief: 
Choose an environmental matter of concern, this could be a species, ecological issue, or environmental infrastructure that you are interested in working with. It should relate to you and be something that others are concerned with, such public perception of an urban species, an exploration of a dynamic natural/built system in the local area. By reflecting on your chosen issue, identify key everyday objects, practices, habits, devices, built environmental features or designed interfaces that define or limit or control or suggest how people think, feel, and act around the issue. Develop a creative work in response to this research, your project might aim to explicate and reveal some aspects of and tensions within your chosen matter of concern, or it might suggest or structure another way for your audience to interact with it.

To start:
* What are the questions that inform your inquiry? Why are you interested in this matter? What don't you know?
* Are you aiming to make your audience/user uncomfortable / inspired / aware / curious / in awe / active / engaged / confused / amused, etc.
