Politics and Poetics of Coexistence

Who am I?

Background in environmental engineering, worked in a relatively innovative area of engineering called water sensitive urban design. Frustrated with end of pipe solutions.

Why creative practice?

Art’s ambiguous, vague qualities will help us think things that remain difficult to put into words. Reading poetry won’t save the planet. Sound science and progressive social policies will do that. But art can allow us to glimpse beings that exist beyond or between our normal categories.
Timothy Morton, 2010

Anthropocene

Welcome to the Anthropocene, a concept proposed by ecologist Eugene Stoermer in the 1980s and made famous by Paul Crutzon in 2000, it is the proposal that we are living in a new geological era, where humans are a dominent environmental force. 

There are varying arguments as to the scope and definition of the Anthropocene.

Was it in the 1780s with invention of the steam engine by James Watt?

The beginning of human agriculture?

Or in 1915 when the German regiment launched chlorine gas over the Ypres front in WWI? The moment that theorist [Peter Sloterdijk](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/terror-air) claims the environment became "explicated".

The anthropocene is the claustrophic realisation that there is no outside.
