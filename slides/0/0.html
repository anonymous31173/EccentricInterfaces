<div data-comment = "I would add methods, networks, data and habits. Technology is culture, culture being a set of socially accepted practices and values. And this of course is never neutral.">

"Technology is not the sum of the artifacts, of the wheels and gears, of the rails and electronic transmitters
Technology is a system. It entails far more than its individual material components.
Technology involves organization, procedures, symbols, new words, equations, and,
most of all, a mindset." </br> - Ursula Franklin</div>

And this week we will be thinking about both of these things as being produced by networks, habits, desires, cultures, science and so on."><img src="https://coyotegulch.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/irrigatedagriculture.jpg"></div>
