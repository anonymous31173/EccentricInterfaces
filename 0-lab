#Lab 0: Sensing

##Arduino
[https://www.arduino.cc/](https://www.arduino.cc/)

**What is it?**

* Open source microcontroller
* Off line board that connects sensors and actuators
* Tutorials and getting started guides are here: 
	* [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)


##Particle 

[https://www.particle.io/](https://www.particle.io/)  
(Photon models)

**What is it?**

* Open source microcontroller (with an Ardunio heart) but with wifi connectivity. 
* 8 digital GPIO pins and 6 analog input pins.
* It is programmed with the same language as Arduino but comes with it's own browser based IDE. 
* Programs are uploaded to each board from the IDE over wifi.
* Although these boards are designed to operate wirelessly, this means you will need to consider [power.](https://docs.particle.io/datasheets/photon-datasheet/#power) They can be powered by  3.6VDC and 5.5VDC batteries via the mini usb port.
* Boards are compatible with sensors, and sensor data is sent to the Particle API 
* Sensor data can easily be set up with IFTTT via the platform.


##Citizen Sensing Kit

[https://smartcitizen.me/](https://smartcitizen.me/)

**What is it?**

* Prebaked sensing kit with wireless connectivity: Measures temperature, Humidity, Light, Sound, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide 
* This board publishes 
* Smart citizen API documentation: [http://developer.smartcitizen.me/#root-endpoint](http://developer.smartcitizen.me/#root-endpoint)
* [API data example](https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/devices/3545/readings?sensor_id=7&rollup=1m&from=2016-07-17&to=2016-07-20)
* 
* [data example 2](https://api.smartcitizen.me/v0/devices/3545/readings?sensor_id=15&rollup=4h&function=max&from=2016-07-17&to=2016-07-20)



##To try (if time permits):

####Particle + Light sensor:

* Login to the [particle build environment](https://build.particle.io).
* Connect your board.
* Go to this [getting started guide](* [Getting started tutorial is here](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/start/photon/)) and read through the device modes section.
* Go to [webIDE section](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/build/photon/) and familiarize yourselves with this section
* Go to the code examples and run through the ["Read your Photoresistor: Function and Variable" section.](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/examples/photon/#read-your-photoresistor-function-and-variable)

**Trouble shooting:**

* Not sure what's happening with your Particle? See this guide describing [device modes.](https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/modes/electron/)
