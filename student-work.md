Project description:
This project attempts to counter the human-centred-design trend and concentrate on smart technologies for the animal kingdom. Chirpee addresses the issues related to the effect of urban pollution (both air quality and sound levels) affecting birds negatively. The issues encountered are an increase in hatchling mortality rate and difficulties for birds to communicate for mating practises and to alert an imminent hazard such as hawks.
Chirpee is able to detect Nitrogen Dioxide levels in the air as well as sound pollution. Depending on the conditions of an area, Chirpee will either emit a mating call to attract birds, or emit the sound of a predator. Depending on the area Chirpee is set in, it will detect what species of birds are present and respond with the correct calls accordingly.
Chirpee therefore prevents species of birds from being exposed to environmental hazards they are not aware of. 
By multiplying the platforms and addressing other issues such as nighttime disturbance of migratory birds by city lights, the platform could help improve the health of bird species in heavily polluted cities around the world.

Project description:
Spiritum exists in a near future where reducing our carbon footprint is a necessity. Carbon conscientious individuals can chose to filter the carbon dioxide created from their breath before releasing it into the air. Spiritum is a planet based filtration system that soaks up the carbon dioxide from our breathe before releasing into the atmosphere.

This study explores nature’s invisible relationship between the honeybee and its’ pollinators.  Creating awareness by personifying the honeybee and humanizing our relationship to the honeybee though the food industry and the image fetishes surrounding modern food culture.  The project realizes human oppression in relationship to the natural ecosystem as "adjunct" by usage of future artefacts and hyperbolic imagery.
  
The project makes aware the necessity of the honeybee and suggests the need for a more biodiverse landscape, the antithesis of the mowed lawn, sculpted garden, and industrial agriculture systems that infiltrates modern society.  The artists question the audience to consider what a more biodiverse ecosystem looks like from the perspective of the honeybee.

Project description:

What does air pollution look like when it’s not visible? Are we aware of what’s invisible? How do we unwittingly contribute to air pollution? We wanted to address the invisible generation of air pollutants and to juxtapose our perceptions of air quality with the reality that we see. Our intervention will hopefully help the audience realize that air pollution is not always egregious in form (ie, smog), but exists even in environmentally-conscious cities like Copenhagen. In an ideal future, we hope this sort of awareness might contribute to paying attention to issues around global warming.

###Reflections on Power
by Katyayani Singh, Nathan Daviss, James Camilleri, Ajit Pillai and Ahmed Al-Nabhani 
Designing an intervention which creates awareness about high energy consumption by playing into the narcissistic and self obsessive manner of people, making them take immediate action to cut down their energy usage.
- Motivation
How can we influence users in their homes to be more careful
about their energy consumption?
How can we make the results of their habits more immediate and more tangible?
- Issues addressed
People consume energy without realising its implications. From our research we came to know that everyone wants to be energy efficient and use the least amount of energy but as there is no immediate intervention, they do not realise that they are consuming higher amount of energy, hence they end up using more.
So, we want to create an awareness about careful consumption of energy by creating short interactive interventions
- The intervention
Our product is connected to the power grid and registers the power consumption. As it comes to know that the energy consumption has gone higher, it automatically pixelates the mirrors, which makes the person realise that higher energy is being consumed and energy consumption needs to be reduced to get the mirror working like it should be.
- Addressing the issue
We are trying to address the narcissistic side of people, where they spend more time taking care of how they look, clicking selfies, etc. By creating this intervention, the people will relate to the message quick about higher energy consumption as they want to see their proper self back again and make them use less energy
- The future
We look at a future where people are aware of the intervention and consciously decide not to use higher energy. Also, we want to replicate the pixelation of yourself in the mirror to other glass based objects in the house, to create an even higher impact. Which will lead people to use even lower energy than the most optimum amount. Also, our initial plan with the project was to link it up with the WiFi, so the intervention happened both in real life and digitally. So as the energy consumption increases, the internet quality reduces. This highly impacts the awareness of energy consumption because people cannot handle the internet being slow.

Technology used:
The "Reflections on Power" piece is comprised of two major technical components. The first, and most immediately noticeable aspect, is the software responsible for pixelating the input feed, while the second is the connective aspect which translates the inputs from the light switches to an appropriately degraded image on the "mirror". In order to facilitate communication between the light sources, and allow for expansion down the line, the entire system was built on a web-based platform, with the core functionality coded in javascript. The Spark Photon was used to communicate between the energy sources and the pixelation application, and the graphical manipulations were carried out using p5.js - a web-based port of the Processing framework. By sampling a scaled-down version of the webcam feed and redrawing the image with larger pixels, the granularity of the image can be adjusted on the fly as values from the light sources change.
